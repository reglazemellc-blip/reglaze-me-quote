# AI CONTEXT — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
Here’s my AI_CONTEXT.md. Use only this as context.
APP:
ReGlaze Me – Internal field app for service contractors

PURPOSE:
Replace paper notes, text messages, and memory with
quotes, invoices, contracts, and PDFs that actually match
how work happens in the field.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
- One file at a time
- No refactors unless explicitly approved
- No schema changes unless explicitly approved
- If something works, DO NOTHING
- PDFs are the authoritative output
- Field workflow > database purity

CURRENT STATE (FACTS ONLY):
- App runs
- Quotes → Invoices → Contracts exist
- PDFs are generated and used
- Used internally by owner, not customers

WHAT IS WORKING WELL:
- [leave blank until you add something]

WHAT IS CONFUSING OR FRAGILE:
- [leave blank until confirmed]

NEXT TASK (ONLY ONE):
- Determine what is sellable as-is vs what truly blocks selling this app.


DO NOT WORK ON YET:
- Apartment / property system
- Client portal
- Payments
- Automation
